<i>KPCA Embeddings: an Unsupervised Approach to Learn Vector Representations of Finite Domain Sequences</i>](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eduardo_Brito8/publication/319710503_KPCA_Embeddings_an_Unsupervised_Approach_to_Learn_Vector_Representations_of_Finite_Domain_Sequences/links/59ba8948aca272416191812b/KPCA-Embeddings-an-Unsupervised-Approach-to-Learn-Vector-Representations-of-Finite-Domain-Sequences.pdf)

You can train KPCA embeddings for various tasks such as junction recognition on DNA sequences from the ["Molecular Biology (Splice-junction Gene Sequences) Data Set"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Molecular+Biology+
(Splice-junction+Gene+Sequences)) from UCI Machine Learning Repository or German verb classification from the [TIGER treebank](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/korpora/TIGERCorpus/download/start.html). The exact hyperparameter combinations can be found in the reference paper.

We also participated in the Dutch spelling correction task from the [Computational Linguistics in the Netherlands 28](http://clin28.cls.ru.nl/shared_task) conference by means of KPCA embeddings. The code of the presented Dutch spell checker is also included in this repository.
